## Documentation Workflow

We aim to keep documentation in sync with code. To achieve this without blocking PRs, we use the following workflow:

1. **When making code changes**: Apply the `pending-docs-update` label to your PR
2. **Documentation updates**: Done in weekly batches (to be automated later)
3. **Cleanup**: Once docs are updated, the label is removed from the PR

This approach allows code changes to land quickly while ensuring documentation stays current.
